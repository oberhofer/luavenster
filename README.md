# Introduction

LuaVenster is an object oriented wrapper for GUI applications on top of the Windows API. 
Although the name LuaVenster is a reminescent to the Win32 Python GUI libraries 
Venster and VensterCE they have no common roots other than the same spirit in being a 
minimal lightweight wrapper that integrates smoothly into the target language Lua.
